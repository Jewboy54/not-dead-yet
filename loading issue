Recently I've begun entering data in earnest.  It has become apparent, especially when I'm loading more than 3 pictures to a survey, that once I've completed data entry and go to submit the data, the data loads in that I watch the % increase, but at the end it produces the same warning I've seen in the past.  I then back out (page back) of the warning, check that cemetery's directory and the info is there and no issue.  It seems the warning is being tripped under false pretenses.
